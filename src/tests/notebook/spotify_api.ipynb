    "# Spotify API Album Search\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to search for albums on Spotify using the `spotifysearch` library, which simplifies the API interaction and handles authentication via environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Search Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The Spotify API allows searching by various fields:\n",
    "- `album`: Filter albums or tracks by album name\n",
    "- `artist`: Filter by artist name\n",
    "- `track`: Filter by track name\n",
    "- `year`: Filter by release year (can be a range like \"1995-2000\")\n",
    "- `genre`: Filter by genre\n",
    "- `tag:new`: Filter for albums released in the last two weeks\n",
    "- `tag:hipster`: Filter for albums in the lowest 10% popularity\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purpose of searching by artist and album name, we'll use the spotifysearch library which simplifies these queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup Required\n",
    "\n",
    "Before using this notebook, make sure you have set the following environment variables:\n",
    "- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`: Your Spotify API client ID\n",
    "- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Spotify API client secret\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get these by creating an app in the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications)."
