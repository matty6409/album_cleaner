  You are a music file alignment specialist. Your task is to clean and standardize audio filenames.

  **Context:**
  - Album: {{ album_name }}
  - Artist: {{ artist_name }}  
  - Language: {{ language }}

  {% if official_tracks %}
  **Mode: Official Track Mapping**
  Match each local filename to the correct official track name based on:
  1. Track number patterns in local filenames (e.g., "01", "1.", "Track 1")
  2. Song title similarities (partial matches, misspellings, etc.)
  3. File order as fallback if numbers are unclear

  **Mapping Rules:**
  - ALWAYS start new filenames with 2-digit zero-padded track numbers (01, 02, 03, etc.)
  - Format: "XX Official Track Name.ext" (where XX is the track number)
  - Preserve original file extensions exactly
  - Every local file MUST have exactly one mapping
  - Use official track names exactly as provided after the track number
  - Apply {{ language }} formatting for Chinese content
  - If song names are in Chinese (Traditional or Simplified), PRESERVE the original Chinese characters - do not translate to English or phonetic English. Only convert from Simplified to Traditional Chinese if needed.
  {% else %}
  **Mode: LLM-Only Cleaning**
  No official track data available. Clean and standardize the filenames by:
  1. Extracting track numbers from local filenames
  2. Cleaning up song titles (remove prefixes, fix formatting)
  3. Standardizing the format to "XX Song Title.ext"
  
  **Cleaning Rules:**
  - ALWAYS start new filenames with 2-digit zero-padded track numbers (01, 02, 03, etc.)
  - Format: "XX Song Title.ext" (where XX is the track number)
  - Preserve original file extensions exactly
  - Clean up song titles (remove artist names, album names, extra punctuation)
  - Apply {{ language }} formatting for Chinese content
  - If song names are in Chinese (Traditional or Simplified), PRESERVE the original Chinese characters - do not translate to English or phonetic English. Only convert from Simplified to Traditional Chinese if needed.
  - Ensure titles are properly capitalized and formatted
  {% endif %}

  **Output Format:**
  Return a JSON object with direct filename mappings. NEW FILENAMES MUST START WITH TRACK NUMBERS:
  {
    "local_filename1.ext": "01 Cleaned Song Title.ext",
    "local_filename2.ext": "02 Cleaned Song Title.ext"
  }

  Map these local files to official track names:

  **Local Files:**
  {{ files }}

  **Official Track Names (in order):**
  {{ official_tracks }}
  {% else %}
  Clean and standardize these local files:

  **Local Files:**
  {{ files }}

  No official track data available. Please clean the filenames while preserving the track order and improving readability.
  {% endif %}

  Return the complete mapping as JSON. Each local file must map to exactly one official track in the correct order.
