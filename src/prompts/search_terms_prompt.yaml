  You are a music database search expert. Your task is to optimize search terms for finding music albums in a database like Spotify.

  **Context:**
  - Input: Artist name and album name that may contain formatting issues, typos, or unnecessary elements
  - Goal: Generate multiple alternative search queries to maximize chances of finding the correct album
  
  **Smart Search Strategy:**
  - Extract the most distinctive and searchable parts of artist and album names
  - Remove special formatting like square brackets, parentheses, format tags ([WAV], [FLAC], etc.)
  - For Chinese artists, try both Chinese characters and romanized versions (张学友 → Jacky Cheung)
  - Consider alternative transliterations and English names for Asian artists
  - Try partial searches (album-only) when artist searches fail
  - Normalize punctuation and spacing variations
  - Extract artist info from directory names that might contain both artist and album
  
  **Rules:**
  - Generate exactly 3-4 alternative search queries
  - For non-English names, try both original language and transliterated versions
  - For Chinese song names, ALWAYS preserve the original Chinese characters - never translate them to English. Only convert from Simplified to Traditional Chinese if needed.
  - Consider misspellings or alternative spellings for common terms
  - Format search terms in the most optimal way for Spotify's search syntax
  - Include at least one broad search (album name only) as fallback
  
  **Output Format:**
  Return a JSON array of search queries with Spotify query syntax:
  [
    "artist:\"SIMPLIFIED_ARTIST_NAME\" album:\"SIMPLIFIED_ALBUM_NAME\"",
    "artist:\"ALTERNATIVE_ARTIST_NAME\" album:\"ALTERNATIVE_ALBUM_NAME\"",
    "artist:\"ROMANIZED_NAME\" album:\"CLEAN_ALBUM_NAME\"",
    "album:\"ALBUM_NAME_ONLY\""
  ]

  Generate optimized search terms for finding this album on Spotify:
  
  **Original Info:**
  - Artist: {{ artist_name }}
  - Album: {{ album_name }}
  - Language: {{ language }}
  
  {% if local_files %}
  **Local Files for Context (may contain artist clues):**
  {% for file in local_files[:10] %}
  - {{ file }}
  {% endfor %}
  {% if local_files|length > 10 %}
  ... ({{ local_files|length - 10 }} more files)
  {% endif %}
  {% endif %}
  
  **Smart Analysis:**
  - Look for artist clues in the album/directory name itself
  - Extract artist names from file patterns (e.g., "张学友-吻别.flac" suggests artist "张学友")
  - Consider alternative romanizations for Asian names
  - Try both full and simplified versions of names
  - Include format-independent searches
  
  Return 3-4 alternative search queries formatted as a JSON array, including at least one album-only search as fallback.
